OMH Chatbot Prototype: Deployment Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Zip the full file (right click --> zip)
3. Navigate to Conversational Agents (https://conversational-agents.cloud.google.com/)
4. Select the correct project. Click "Create agent," then "Build your own."
5. Create an appropriate name, location, and time zone. Select "Playbook" as the conversation start.
6. Next to your new agent's name, click the 3 dots on the right hand side of the screen. Click "Restore."
7. Upload a local file. Find the .zip you created earlier. **Critical** Select "Use default settings" - this will let us bypass changes we will need to make to the agent (e.g., creating a new data store) and get the agent up and running more quickly.
8. Click "Restore." After a few moments, the agent will populate and you can start editing.
